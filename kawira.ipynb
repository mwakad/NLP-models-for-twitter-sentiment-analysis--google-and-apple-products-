    "\n",
    "This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on tweets related to Apple and Google products using a labeled dataset. By classifying tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, we seek to understand public perception of these tech giants and uncover trends in user opinion. The dataset offers a realistic glimpse into consumer sentiment, making it ideal for training and evaluating NLP classification models."

    "\n",
    "With millions of users sharing their opinions on social media, understanding customer sentiment toward major tech brands is vital. This project seeks to automatically classify tweets mentioning Apple and Google products into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. By leveraging natural language processing, we aim to build a model that can extract meaningful insights from public opinion, helping stakeholders understand brand perception and inform strategic decisions."

    "### Dataset Overview: \"tweet_product_company.csv\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset captures real-world tweet data mentioning Apple and Google products, offering a rich source of public sentiment expressed through social media. Each entry typically includes the tweet's text, the referenced product, the associated company (Apple or Google), and a sentiment label—categorized as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset was curated from Twitter via public scraping or aggregated repositories, specifically targeting mentions of Apple and Google. While exact sourcing details may vary, the collection aligns with ethical standards for public tweet analysis and is commonly used in NLP and sentiment modeling projects. It reflects organic user opinions and consumer reactions across various product releases, updates, and experiences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Dataset?\n",
    "\n",
    "This data is perfectly suited for sentiment analysis because:\n",
    "- Tweets are short, noisy, and opinion-driven—ideal for testing robust NLP techniques.\n",
    "- It supports both **binary** classification (positive vs negative) and **multiclass** sentiment prediction.\n",
    "- Comparative sentiment between Apple and Google enables business insights and brand analysis.\n",
    "- It offers real-world variability—emoji usage, slang, abbreviations—which makes preprocessing more meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this dataset, we aim to:\n",
    "- Understand how users perceive Apple vs. Google across time.\n",
    "- Build a scalable model that can automatically detect sentiment in real time.\n",
    "- Extract actionable insights that can guide marketing, product improvements, and customer engagement.\n"
